                            Welcome from Cary Grace and Diane Offereins</h2>
                        <p class="wow fadeInBottom" data-wow-duration=".35s">
                            Welcome to our 2019-2020 Year in Review! 
                            While this year was one of disruption and innovation 
                            for our organization, we continued to live into our 
                            purpose - empowering women to lead! - mission, vision, and values in all that we do. 
                            We launched several new digital initiatives, elected our 
                            most diverse slate of new members, and found new paths for 
                            strategic improvements. Also of great significance to our 
                            operations, we selected and smoothly executed leadership 
                            succession, announcing Maria Doughty as our new President 
                            and CEO in March 2020. Maria is no stranger to crisis 
                            management and in short, she is the right leader at 
                            the right time for us.<br><br>
                            Our hope is that within 10 years we will be at the next 
                            frontier of women’s equity and inclusion because The 
                            Chicago Network will have helped meaningfully move the 
                            ball forward from where we are today. Because of 
                            engagement/support in all the activities and 
                            initiatives you see reflected inside, we know 
                            there will continue to be an abundance of stories 
                            about how The Network has made a difference in 
                            empowering women of all colors to lead.<br><br>
                            Sincerely,
                        </p>

                            As we passed the one-year anniversary of our Equity 
                            Principles campaign, the necessity of promoting and 
                            achieving equity became more critical than ever. 
                            We must continue to shine a spotlight on gender 
                            equity when inclusion and diversity are most at risk. 
                            Support from our Equity Pledge signatories is vital 
                            to safeguard against losing ground. Join our 100+

                            do not yet have a seat at the table.

                                    At the annual kick off to our programming season, we enjoyed a rich discussion among women leaders who have taken over their family businesses and built them into powerhouse enterprises. Each of these women had to make the decision to step into the top role and now they have all strategically grown their businesses.

The evening also brought in several professional clothing donations from members, which were distributed to our Future Leaders partner schools so that their women students have access to professional clothes for interviews and other such opportunities.

                                    At our Annual Meeting we elected the new slate of Board of Directors followed by a very special program by Ancestry. As the leader of a 30-year-old company that has innovated through multiple technological evolutions, Ancestry President and CEO Margo Georgiadis shared how she’s transforming the company to serve its customers in entirely new ways. Margo was joined in conversation by Ancestry Chief Scientific Officer Cathy Ball, who is leading the company’s efforts to rethink how it leverages its unique scientific assets and Ancestry’s powerful community to make new discoveries to help in the fight against COVID-19.

I’ve observed that women and people of color tend to create an “us vs. them” paradigm — that certain kinds of success are for them, not us. But really it’s for them and us.” I wouldn’t have gotten where I am today if I hadn’t been able to overcome that “us vs. them” mentality, and feel confident that I belong at certain tables, too.

                            The app allows members to look up other members and directly 
                            call or email them, register for events, and update their own profile.
